# Karton

A small, rusty pastebin with URL shortener functionality.

The github repository is a mirror of [this gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/obsidianical/microbin).

This is a fork of [MicroBin](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin).

## Features 

- Animal names (by default) or custom namefiles instead of just hashes (though hashes are an option too!)
- File and image uploads
- raw text serving
- URL shortening
- QR codes
- Listing and removing pastas (though currently everyone can do that)
- Expiration times
- Editable pastas
- Syntax highlighting
- Styling via [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css)
- Customizable endpoints

## Installation guide

Karton is available on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/schrottkatze/karton), [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/karton) and using the nix flake.

The only "officially supported" (I will actively debug and search for the problem) method is the last one using nix flakes.

### Installation via the nix flake

Add the repository to your inputs.

```nix
	karton.url = "git+https://gitlab.com/obsidianical/microbin.git";
```

```nix
# microbin.nix
{ inputs, config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.karton.defaultPackage."x86_64-linux" ];
  systemd.services.karton = {
    after = [ "network.target" ];
    wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
    environment = {
	  # set environment variables to configure karton
      KARTON_HASH_IDS = "";
      KARTON_EDITABLE = "";
      KARTON_PRIVATE = "";
      KARTON_HIGHLIGHTSYNTAX = "";
      # adjust this to your domain
      KARTON_PUBLIC_PATH = "https://example.org";
      KARTON_QR = "";
      # configure endpoints to be shorter
      KARTON_URL_EP = "u";
      KARTON_RAW_EP = "r";
      KARTON_PASTA_EP = "p";
    };
    script = "${inputs.karton.defaultPackage."x86_64-linux"}/bin/karton";
    # register a simple systemd service
    serviceConfig = {
      Type = "simple";
      RootDirectory="/";
      WorkingDirectory = "/karton";
    };
  };
}
```
